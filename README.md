<h1>Problem Staement</h1>
<h5>One of the most promising applications of visual object recognition in computer vision is food image recognition 
and food monitoring is becoming increasingly important in our daily lives. The creation of an effective and more 
comfortable solution for getting the recipe has been made feasible by recent advancements in smartphone and 
web applications. However, most of these applications require manual input of food items. Despite the thousands 
of applications, methods, and systems available, the machine learning and computer vision groups have yet to 
properly handle the challenge of identifying food due to the lack of distinct and spatial arrangement, which is 
often present in images showing scenes or items. Also the Image recognition of food products is typically difficult 
due to the large diversity of varieties of food. Therefore recognizing the food and getting the recipe in one place 
can be a lifesaver. The goal of this project is to create a system to identify food from the images, solve the 
challenges of automatically recognising an image of food and generating the corresponding recipe.</h5>
